# Bright
The Bright App, an app for sourcing the brightest of ideas. 

#Technologies
The app currently contains 1 Angular5/Node.js and 1 SpringMVC Client which both consume RESTful APIs powered by 2 Spring Boot/Tomcat services and 1 Python/Django service. 

#Learning
The objective is to build an app with RESTful microservices to support an agile-like development/learning style. 
The app architechture will be able feed any form of client app (Web and Mobile) and should be scalable with container infrastructure.
To focus concerns on microserivces, should enable a focus to explore different technologies and DevOps challenges while avoiding tech debt.
