# Bright
The Bright App, an app for sourcing the brightest of ideas. 

# Technologies
The app currently contains:
1 Angular5/Node.js client,
1 SpringMVC client, which both consume RESTful APIs.
They are powered by 2 Spring Boot/Tomcat services and 1 Python/Django service. 

# Learning
The objective is to build an app with RESTful microservices to support an agile-like development/learning style. 
The app architechture will be able feed any form of client app (Web and Mobile) and should be scalable with container infrastructure.
A focus on microserivces, should enable an exploration of different technologies and DevOps challenges while avoiding tech debt.
